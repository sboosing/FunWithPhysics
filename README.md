# FunWithPhysics
A TechTogerther Boston Hackathon project 

### A Bit about the Project
Fun with Physics teaches elementary school aged children about the physics of sound. Kids can see the amplitude, pitch and intensity of the music they play or even their own voice while learning the accompanying science concepts on our website. 

With the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot was lost for young school children. It has been harder than ever for teachers and keeping students, especially young elementary schoolers, engaged can be extremely difficult. 

We wanted to encourage a love and fascination with STEM from an early age since they already have a harder time learning and might miss these opportunities. We hoped that developing an interactive product that can be used virtually or in the classroom would help with this. Considering that many elementary-aged kids play an instrument for school, what better way to demonstrate just how cool physics is if not through the power of music!

By bringing in science to “record karate lessons” or letting young kids use their own voice to learn about physics and study sound, we hope to help facilitate future leaders in STEM. So grab your DeciBot, hop onto Fun with Physics, and let's start learning!
